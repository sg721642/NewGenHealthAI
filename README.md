An AI-powered medical assistant with a FastAPI backend and a React frontend for conversational clinical guidance, session-based chat, and image-based disease analysis. Deployed and publicly accessible through Hugging Face Spaces.

## Overview

NewGenHealthAI is a full-stack healthcare AI application designed to support medical interaction workflows through:

* conversational AI assistance
* image-based disease analysis
* session-based chat history
* diagnostics and model inspection utilities
* containerized deployment with Docker

The project is organized as a monorepo with separate backend and frontend applications.

## Features

* AI-powered medical assistant interface
* FastAPI backend API
* React + Vite frontend
* Session-based conversation history
* Medical image analysis endpoint
* Model diagnostics endpoint
* Local testing utilities for medical images
* Docker support for deployment

## Tech Stack

### Backend

* Python
* FastAPI
* Uvicorn
* LangChain / LangGraph
* ChromaDB
* Sentence Transformers
* Hugging Face Transformers
* PyTorch
* SQLAlchemy

### Frontend

* React
* Vite
* Tailwind CSS
* DaisyUI

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root based on `.env.example`.

Required variables include:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key_here
SESSION_SECRET_KEY=your_session_secret_key_here
```

Optional path overrides may also be configured for logs, database, vector store, and PDF sources.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sg721642/NewGenHealthAI.git
cd NewGenHealthAI
```

### 2. Backend setup

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

**Windows**

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Linux / macOS**

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Frontend setup

Open a new terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

## Running the Project

### Option 1: Start with the root launcher

From the project root folder:

```bash
python run.py
```

This script:

* creates a virtual environment if needed
* installs backend dependencies
* installs frontend dependencies
* starts the backend on port `8000`
* waits for the backend health endpoint
* launches the frontend development server

### Option 2: Run backend and frontend separately

#### Start backend

```bash
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

#### Start frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## API Endpoints

Some important backend routes include:

* `GET /api/v1/health` — backend health check
* `GET /api/v1/diagnostics` — loaded model diagnostics
* `POST /api/v1/analyze-image` — upload an image for analysis

Depending on your backend router definitions, additional chat and session endpoints are also available.

## Testing

### Backend tests

Run pytest inside the backend folder:

```bash
cd backend
pytest
```

### Image API test script

```bash
cd backend
python test_api.py
```

### CLIP routing verification

```bash
cd backend
python test_clip_routing.py
```

These scripts test image classification and verify that domain routing works correctly for sample images such as skin, xray, and retina inputs.

## Docker

Dockerfiles are included for:

* project root
* backend
* frontend

You can use them to build and containerize the entire application or individual services depending on your deployment setup.

## Frontend

The frontend is built with React and Vite and provides:

* chat-based interaction
* conversation history
* a clean medical assistant interface

To create a production build:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

To preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Utilities

The project also includes utility scripts such as:

* `check_model_on_image.py` — test model behavior on a single image
* `diagnose_env.py` — inspect environment setup and issues
* `inspect_models.py` — inspect backend model loading/configuration
* `run_medai.bat` — Windows launcher helper

## Use Cases

* AI-assisted symptom guidance
* educational medical assistant demos
* image-based disease analysis workflows
* research prototypes for healthcare AI systems
